The following is my open notebook for the class

### HIST 5702w - Digital History Methods as Public History Performance

The following are the open notebook topics for the class. Each notebook entry was created in markdown and then converted to an html page using pandoc. The notebook is served using github. The following are the topics of the notebook:

* Automated downloading using **WGET**
* Datamining the **Internet Archive**

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
