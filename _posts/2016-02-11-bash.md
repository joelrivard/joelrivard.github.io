This tutorial introduced us to various command line commands that are common in windows or OSx environment.
The writers do an excellent job of introducing and explaining the various commands that can be used with the command line.

Having previous experience with command line tools windows, this was a really good revision and I picked up on a few new commands that will come handy in the future.
  1. Using Vim within bash to look read/write documents
  2. Using the commands "head" and "trail" is great to read the first or last lines of a really long document

Having gone through this tutorial, I now hope to use the command line tools more often. To aid with this (and practice making a table with markdown), I thought I'd replicate the wonderful overview of commands that was given to us at the end by the authors:

| Command | What It Does |
| --------- | --------- |
| pwd | Prints the 'present working directory' letting you know where you are|
| ls | Lists the files in the current directory|
| man * | Lists the manual for the command, substituted for the *|
| cd * |	Changes the current directory to *|
| mkdir * |	Makes a directory named * |
| open or explorer | On OS X, open followed by a file opens it; in Windows, the command explorer followed by a file name does the same thing.|
| cat * |	cat is a versatile command. It will read a file to you if you substitute a file for *, but can also be used to combine files. |
| head * |	Displays the first ten lines of * |
| tail * |	Displays the last ten lines of * |
| mv |	Moves a file |
| cp |	Copies a file |
| rm | Deletes a file |
| vim | 	Opens up the vim document editor.|
| grep | Global regular expression print

  1. -c allows users to count the number of time a specific word.
  2. -i retrieves both upper and lower cases. Can be used with the -c (ic) or -v (ic)
  3. -v retrieves items that don't include the specific word.|
