###Definition:###
According to wikipedia, regular expressions are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern for use in a find and replace operations.

###Where can Regular Expressions be used?###
Regular Expressions can be used on text documents that have some sort of unstrucsture or loose patterns. Users need to be aware of the following before beginning to use Regular Expressions.

1. Choose a text editor that can harness regular expressions and figure out how Regex works in that software. Libre Office, Sublime, Notepad ++ all behave somewhat differently.

2. Be familiar with your text and what type of strucuture you want in the end. 

3. Familiarize yourself with the most common regular expressions.

| Regex | What It Does |
| --------- | --------- |
|A b 1 | literals â€” letters, digits, and spaces match themselves |
|[Ab1] | a character class, matching one instance of any of A, b, or 1 in this case |
|[a-z] | all lowercase letters within a range |
|[0-9] | all digits |
|. | any character |
|* | zero or more |
|+ | one or more |
|( ) | if contents within parentheses match, define a group for future reference |
|$1 | refer to a matched group (this is the notation in LibreOffice; other notations such as \1 are sometimes used elsewhere) |
|\t | tab |
|^ | beginning of line |
|$ | end of line |
